# Creature System (CCT)

To find a creature you need the Planet and type (Predator/Prey/Critter) and a picture. Names are injected by CCT instance naming rules so are mostly useless when trying to find the creature. The planet gets you to the PCM NPC record match the skin keyword to the nif of the picture. Usually a planet only has 2-3 predators and 2-3 prey so it is not too time consuming. The creature type record for the planet will get you to the base CCT NPC records and OMODS which define it.

The Creature system uses keywords to inject OMod modifications on to a spawned NPC to modify its skin, size, attacks, armor, type (walker/flyer/swimmer), etc.

Creature attacks are just 1H, 2H, or Unarmed weapons with a CCT prefix. Some creatures have spitting attacks which are CCT prefixed spells. You can quickly get to the base weapon/spell using the OMod on the creature.
