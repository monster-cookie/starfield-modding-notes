# NPCs - Vendors

- You can use the ATTX field on the NPC record to override the button text for activating a NPC. IE make it Slap vs Talk.

## Normal Vendors

## Vendor Kiosks

## Ship Services Technician

### Known Bugs
- Ship Services Ship sales cannot replenish credits.
    - If you make a new ship it will put those credits in the pot.
    - Also the ship services terminal on your outpost landing pad can replenish its stock of credits so is great place to sell ships
- NPC Ship tech must have the VoiceType NPCM_Shipservices or all dialog stops working. BGS only implemented the male version of this voice type so the NPC must be male.
