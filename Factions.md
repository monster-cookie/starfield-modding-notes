# Factions

There are 3 types of factions Normal, Crime, and Group which largey do unique things. Normal and Crime are related and a crime faction can replace a normal faction but not the other way around. Techically there is a forth faction type the Vendor faciton but it really just a normal faction with additional settings. 

## Normal Faction

Normal factions establish ownership of locations/planets/systems and relations to other factions. Also factions can be used for checks that cannot be made easily using other gamse systems so you may see some that don't really define anything.

See EclipticFaction [FACT:0027028D]

## Crime Faction 

Are normal factions that define a jail and bounty values for the owned regions and its member npcs

See CrimeFactionCrimsonFleet "Crimson Fleet" [FACT:00010B30]

## Vendor Faction

Again are normal factions that define the factions buy/sell lists, values, and storage container

See Vendor_Station_Key_AludraTahan_Faction [FACT:00133C01]

## Group Factions

Group factions are a NPC reaction behavior setting that defines some fields that the reaction radius stuff uses for triggering NPC behavior attack, warn, alarm, flee. All combat factions should have one defined and linked to all NPCs in the facitons.
