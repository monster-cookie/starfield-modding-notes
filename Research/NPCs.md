A lot of persistent NPC changes require NG+ reset, but you can sometimes spoof it with Disable/Enable and ResetInventory in the console. Companion resets are a lot more work. Also if the NPC is bound to a handler quests (think SQ_Crew, etc) you will have to reset the quest or use what ever reset path the quest script provides. Again see Companions for an example.

# Template Actors

==TODO - Finish this table==

| Template Actor | Affects |
| ---- | ---- |
| Trait | Appearence Data |
| Stats | XP<br>Level and Level multiplier<br>Properties |

- Template actors fully override anything on the NPC records. For example Cora's initial dark hair and wrong hair cut were caused by the linked trait template actor's setting.
